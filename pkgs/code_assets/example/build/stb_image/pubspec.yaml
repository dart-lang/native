name: stb_image
description: |
  This project is a minimal, cross-platform demonstration of how to use Dart's
  build hooks, with code assets and `dart:ffi` to call a simple function from a
  popular C library. This project uses `stbi_info` from the `stb_image.h`
  library to read an image's dimensions and color channels without loading the
  entire file into memory.
