A library to use in build hooks (`hook/build.dart`).

For more documentation on adding native code to your package, refer to the API
docs of [`package:code_assets`](https://pub.dev/packages/code_assets).

## Status: In Preview

**NOTE**: This package is currently in preview and published under the
[labs.dart.dev](https://dart.dev/dart-team-packages) pub publisher in order to
solicit feedback. 

For packages in the labs.dart.dev publisher we generally plan to either graduate
the package into a supported publisher (dart.dev, tools.dart.dev) after a period
of feedback and iteration, or discontinue the package. These packages have a
much higher expected rate of API and breaking changes.

Your feedback is valuable and will help us evolve this package. 
For bugs, please file an issue in the 
[bug tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/issues).
