## 5.0.0-wip

- __Breaking change__: Rename the `NSString` to `String` conversion method from
  `toString()` to `toDartString()`.
- Add `ObjCProtocolBase`, which all code genned protocols implement.
- Add various ObjC categories (extension methods) to the built in classes.
- Make all visible API types public.

## 4.1.0

- Use ffigen 16.1.0
- Reduces the chances of duplicate symbols by adding a `DOBJC_` prefix.
- Ensure that required symbols are available to FFI even when the final binary
  is linked with `-dead_strip`.
- Add support for blocking ObjC protocol methods.

## 4.0.0

- Use ffigen 16.0.0
- Add `NSOrderedCollectionDifference` to the package.
- __Breaking change__: As part of ffigen 16.0.0, the way ObjC categories are
  generated has changed. Instead of inserting their methods into the interface,
  categories now generate Dart extension methods. For ordinary methods this
  makes no difference, but static methods now need to be invoked on the
  extension instead of on the class. `MyInterface.staticMethod` must change to
  `MyCategory.staticMethod`
- __Breaking change__`: Another effect of the category overhaul is that we don't
  automatically included all categories any more. This reduces the ammount of
  bindings generated by omitting methods from obscure categories that most users
  don't need. If you notice that a method you were using is now missing, there
  are two options:
    1. Look up which category it came from in the Apple documentation, and
       generate bindings for that category yourself in your own package.
    2. If the category is common/important enough that it should be included
       in package:objective_c, file a bug and we'll consider adding it back in.
- Fixed [a bug](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/issues/1702) where missing
  methods could cause runtime errors, even if they weren't being implemented.
- Throw more useful errors in all internal failure cases.
- Added `ObjCProtocolMethod.isAvailable` getter, to make it easier to implement
  fallback logic if a method is missing at runtime.

## 3.0.0

- Add the following stream-related types to the core package:
  - `NSInputStream`
  - `NSOutputStream`
  - `NSRunLoop`
  - `NSStream`
  - `NSStreamDelegate`
  - `NSStreamEvent`
  - `NSStreamStatus`
- Add `UnimplementedOptionalMethodException`, which is thrown by the ObjC
  bindings if an optional method is invoked, and the instance doesn't implement
  the method.
- Dispatch all object/block releases to the main thread.
- Add utils for converting Dart `String`s to Objective-C selectors and back.
- Require Dart 3.4 or later (due to the use of `dart:ffi`
  `Struct.create` by `package:ffigen`).
- __Breaking change__: Return structs from ObjC methods by value instead of
  taking a struct return pointer.

## 2.0.0

- Drop API methods that are deprecated in the oldest versions of iOS and macOS
  that flutter supports.
- Added `ObjCBlock`, which is the new user-facing representation of ObjC blocks.
- Migrate to ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).
- Enable ObjC objects and blocks to be sent between isolates.
- Add `autorelease` and `retainAndAutorelease` methods to ObjC objects and
  blocks.
- __Breaking change__: Remove some convenience methods from `_ObjCRefHolder`:
  `isReleased`, `release`, `pointer`, and `retainAndReturnPointer`. Uses of
  these methods now need to go through `.ref`. Eg `obj.pointer` becomes
  `obj.ref.pointer`.

## 1.1.0

- Add `DartProxy`, which is an implementation of `NSProxy` that enables
  implementing ObjC protocols from Dart. Also adds `DartProxyBuilder` for
  constructing `DartProxy`.
- Add some extensions methods for `NSMutableData`.
- Fix the `NSError` bindings so that they're not empty.
- Add `ObjCProtocolBuilder`, which is an ergonomic wrapper around
  `DartProxyBuilder`.
- Add `ObjCProtocolMethod`, which contains all the information that
  `ObjCProtocolBuilder` needs to implement a method. These objects are created
  by the ffigen bindings for a protocol.
- Make all of the code-genned structs and enums public so they can be reused by
  user bindings.
- Use `package:dart_flutter_team_lints`.

## 1.0.1

- Mention experimental status in readme.

## 1.0.0

- Move sharable code from ffigen's generated code into this package, including
  `ObjCObjectBase`, and `ObjCBlockBase`, as well as the core Objective C runtime
  functions (except `objc_msgSend`, which is library specific).
- Move core ObjC classes such as `NSString` into this package.
- Delete Dart functions associated with ObjC closure blocks when the block is
  destroyed. Fixes https://github.com/dart-lang/native/issues/204
- Improve debuggability of memory management errors.
