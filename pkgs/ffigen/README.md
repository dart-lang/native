## Introduction

Bindings generator for [FFI](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop) bindings.

> Note: FFIgen only supports parsing `C` headers, not `C++` headers.

This bindings generator can be used to call C code or code in another language
that compiles to C modules that follow the C calling convention, such as Go or 
Rust. For more details, see https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop.

FFIgen also has experimental support for calling ObjC and Swift code;
for details see https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/objective-c-interop.

More FFIgen documentation can be found [here](doc/README.md).

## Getting Started

This guide demonstrates how to call a custom C API from a standalone Dart
application. It assumes that Dart has been set up 
([instructions](https://dart.dev/get-dart)) and that LLVM is installed on the
system ([instructions](#requirements)). Furthermore, it assumes that the Dart
app has been created via `dart create ffigen_example`.

1. Add the utility package `package:ffi` as a dependency and the bindings 
   generator `package:ffigen` as a dev_dependency to the pubspec of your app by
   running: `dart pub add ffi dev:ffigen`.

2. Write the C code and place it inside a subdirectory of your app. For this
   example we will place the following code in `src/add.h` and `src/add.c`
   respectively. It defines a simple API to add two integers in C.

   ```C
   // in src/add.h:
   
   int add(int a, int b);
   ```

   ```C
   // in src/add.c:
   
   int add(int a, int b) {
     return a + b;
   }
   ```

3. To generate the bindings, we will write a script using `package:ffigen` and
   place it under `tool/ffigen.dart`. The script instantiates and configures a
   `FfiGenerator`. Refer to the code comments below and the API docs to learn
   more about available configuration options.

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';

   import 'package:ffigen/ffigen.dart';
   
   void main() {
     final packageRoot = Platform.script.resolve('../');
     FfiGenerator(
       // Required. Output path for the generated bindings.
       output: Output(dartFile: packageRoot.resolve('lib/add.g.dart')),
       // Optional. Where to look for header files.
       headers: Headers(entryPoints: [packageRoot.resolve('src/add.h')]),
       // Optional. What functions to generate bindings for.
       functions: Functions.includeSet({'add'}),
     ).generate();
   }
   ```

4. Run the script with `dart run tool/ffigen.dart` to generate the bindings.
   This will create the output `lib/add.g.dart` file, which can be imported by
   Dart code to access the C APIs. This command must be re-run whenever the
   FFIgen configuration (in `tool/ffigen.dart`) or the C sources for which
   bindings are generated change.

5. Import `add.g.dart` in your Dart app and call the generated methods to access
   the native C API:

   ```dart
   import 'add.g.dart';

   // ...
   
   void answerToLife() {
     print('The answer to the Ultimate Question is ${add(40, 2)}!');
   }
   ```

6. Before we can run the app, we need to compile the C sources. There are many
   ways to do that. For this example, we are using a
   [build hook](https://dart.dev/tools/hooks), which we define in
   `hook/build.dart` as follows. This build hook also requires a dependency
   on the `hooks`, `code_assets`, and `native_toolchain_c` helper packages,
   which we can add to our app by running
   `dart pub add hooks code_assets native_toolchain_c`.

   ```dart
   import 'package:code_assets/code_assets.dart';
   import 'package:hooks/hooks.dart';
   import 'package:native_toolchain_c/native_toolchain_c.dart';
   
   void main(List<String> args) async {
     await build(args, (input, output) async {
       if (input.config.buildCodeAssets) {
         final builder = CBuilder.library(
           name: 'add',
           assetName: 'add.g.dart',
           sources: ['src/add.c'],
         );
         await builder.run(input: input, output: output);
       }
     });
   }
   ```

That's it! Run your app with `dart run` to see it in action!

The complete and runnable example can be found in [example/add](example/add).

## More Examples

The `code_asset` package contains [comprehensive examples](../code_assets/example)
that showcase FFIgen. Additional examples that show how FFIgen can be used
in different scenarios can also be found in the [example](example/) directory.

## Requirements

LLVM (9+) must be installed on your system to use `package:ffigen`. Install it
in the following way:

### Linux

1. Install libclangdev:
   * with apt-get: `sudo apt-get install libclang-dev`.
   * with dnf: `sudo dnf install clang-devel`.

### Windows

1. Install Visual Studio with C++ development support.
2. Install [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) or 
   `winget install -e --id LLVM.LLVM`.

#### macOS

1. Install Xcode.
2. Install Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`.

## YAML Configuration Reference

In addition to the Dart API shown in the "Getting Started" section, FFIgen can
also be configured via YAML. Support for the YAML configuration will be
eventually phased out, and using the Dart API is recommended.

A YAML configuration can be either provided in the project's `pubspec.yaml` file
under the key `ffigen` or via a custom YAML file. To generate bindings
configured via YAML run either `dart run ffigen` if using the `pubspec.yaml`
file or run `dart run ffigen --config config.yaml` where `config.yaml` is the
path to your custom YAML file.

The following configuration options are available:

      Filters for Objective-C interface, protocol, and category declarations.
      This option works the same as other declaration filters like `functions`
      and `structs`.

      Adds a module prefix to the interface/protocol name when loading it
      from the dylib. This is only relevant for ObjC headers that are generated
      wrappers for a Swift library. See example/swift for more information.

      Filters interface and protocol methods and properties. This is a map from
      interface name to a list of method include and exclude rules. The
      interface name can be a regexp. The include and exclude rules work exactly
      like any other declaration. See
      <a href="#how-does-objc-method-filtering-work">below</a> for more details.

      By default, Objective-C interfaces and protocols that are not directly
      included by the inclusion rules, but are transitively depended on by
      the inclusions, are not fully code genned. Transitively included
      interfaces are generated as stubs, and transitive protocols are omitted.

      By default, if an Objective-C interface is included in the bindings, all
      the categories that extend it are also included. To filter them, set this
      flag to false, then use objc-categories to include/exclude particular
      categories.
      <br><br>
      Transitive categories are generated by default because it's not always
      obvious from the Apple documentation which interface methods are declared
      directly in the interface, and which are declared in categories. So it may
      appear that the interface is missing methods, when in fact those methods
      are part of a category. This would be a difficult problem to diagnose if
      transitive categories were not generated by default.
