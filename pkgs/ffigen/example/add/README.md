A simple end-to-end example using FFIgen.

FFIgen bindings are generated by the script in `tool/ffigen.dart`. Execute
`dart run tool/ffigen.dart` to regenerate the bindings.

The C source files for which bindings are generated are located in `src/`.

The bindings are imported and used by `lib/add.dart`.

To run the app and see it in action execute `dart run`.
