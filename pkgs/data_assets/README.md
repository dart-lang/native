This library contains the hook protocol specification for bundling data assets
with Dart packages.

## This package is documentation only for the moment.

For using this feature, please refer to `package:native_assets_cli` for now.
In the future, we'll split up that package into here.

## Status: Experimental

**NOTE**: This package is currently experimental and published under the
[labs.dart.dev](https://dart.dev/dart-team-packages) pub publisher in order to
solicit feedback. 

For packages in the labs.dart.dev publisher we generally plan to either graduate
the package into a supported publisher (dart.dev, tools.dart.dev) after a period
of feedback and iteration, or discontinue the package. These packages have a
much higher expected rate of API and breaking changes.

Your feedback is valuable and will help us evolve this package. 
For bugs, please file an issue in the 
[bug tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/issues).
