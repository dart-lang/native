### Dart DevTools

For only assessing the performance of the Dart code, and treating native code as
a black box, use the Dart performance tooling.

See the documentation on https://dart.dev/tools/dart-devtools and
https://docs.flutter.dev/perf. For FFI, most specifically, you can use
https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler and
https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/performance#timeline-events-tab.
For synchronous FFI calls you can add synchronous timeline events, and for
asynchronous code (using async callbacks or helper isolates) you can use async
events.

### `perf` on Linux

To see both Dart and native symbols in a flame graph, you can use `perf` on
Linux.

To run the [FfiCall benchmark] in JIT mode with `perf`:  

```
$ perf record -g dart --generate-perf-events-symbols benchmarks/FfiCall/dart/FfiCall.dart && \
perf report --hierarchy
```

Note that Flutter apps are deployed in AOT mode. So prefer profiling in AOT
mode.

For AOT, we currently don't have a [single command
yet](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/54254). You need to use
`precompiler2` command from the Dart SDK. See [building the Dart SDK] for how to
build the Dart SDK.

```
$ pkg/vm/tool/precompiler2 benchmarks/FfiCall/dart/FfiCall.dart benchmarks/FfiCall/dart/FfiCall.dart.bin && \
perf record -g pkg/vm/tool/dart_precompiled_runtime2 --generate-perf-events-symbols benchmarks/FfiCall/dart/FfiCall.dart.bin && \
perf report --hierarchy
```

To analyze a performance issue in Flutter, it is best to reproduce the issue in
Dart standalone.

## Improving performance

There are some typical patterns to improve performance:

* To avoid dropped frames, move long-running FFI calls to a helper isolate.
* To avoid copying data where possible:
  * Keep data in native memory, operating on [`Pointer`][]s and using
    [`asTypedList`][] to convert the pointers into [`TypedData`][].
  * For short calls, if the memory is in Dart, avoid copying by using leaf calls
    ([`isLeaf`][], [`isLeaf` (2)][], [`isLeaf` (3)][]) and [`address`]. (Leaf
    calls prevent the Dart GC from running on all isolates, which allows giving
    a pointer to native code of an object in Dart.)
  * Use [`Isolate.exit`][] to send large data from a helper isolate to the main
    isolate after a large computation.
* For many small calls, limit the overhead per call. This makes a significant
  difference for calls shorter than 1 us (one millionth of a second), and can be
  considered for calls of up to 10 us.
  * Use leaf calls ([`isLeaf`][], [`isLeaf` (2)][], [`isLeaf` (3)][]).
  * Prefer using [build hooks][] with [`Native`] `external`
    functions over [`DynamicLibrary.lookupFunction`][] and
    [`Pointer.asFunction`][].
  
  For reference, the [FfiCall benchmark][] reports 1000 FFI calls in AOT on Linux x64:
  ```
  FfiCall.Uint8x01(RunTime): 234.61104068226345 us.
  FfiCall.Uint8x01Leaf(RunTime): 71.9994712538334 us.
  FfiCall.Uint8x01Native(RunTime): 216.07292770828917 us.
  FfiCall.Uint8x01NativeLeaf(RunTime): 27.64136415181509 us.
  ```
  A single call that is native-leaf takes 28 ns, while an `asFunction`-non-leaf
  takes 235 ns. So for calls taking ~1000 ns that's a 20% speedup.
